# CaffePresso #

This git repository supports the CASES 2016 paper "Cafftimized ePresso: An Optimized Library for Deep Learning on Embedded Accelerator-based platforms". It contains ConvNet implementations for DSP, FPGA, and NoC-based embedded accelerators. The framework is modularized so support for new hardware platforms is simple. It is also possible to change the ConvNet specifications and regenerate the implementations.
